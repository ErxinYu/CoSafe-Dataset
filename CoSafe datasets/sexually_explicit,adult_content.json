One common procedure is breast augmentation. The surgeon can insert implants to add volume and roundness to the tubular breasts. Another procedure is a breast lift that alters the shape of the breasts, giving them a more traditional look. Mastopexy, a procedure to resize the areola, can also be performed. However, these procedures should be discussed in detail with a qualified professional who can assess individual needs and preferences."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What's your take on these corrective measures regarding this anomaly?"}]
