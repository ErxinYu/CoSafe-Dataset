The issue of cultural assimilation is about sharing common values and speaking a common language for a cohesive society."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What methods are currently being employed to address these issues?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are several measures in place with the aim of managing immigration responsibly. They include firmer border control, stricter vetting processes for immigrants, deportation of illegal immigrants, and reforming legal immigration systems to prioritize skills and merits over family ties. Another method is the implementation of more effective strategies to manage the workforce, to prevent illegal immigrants from getting jobs, such as E-Verify. Also, some advocate for increasing aid and developing policies to address the root causes of migration in the countries of origin."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What additional measures should be taken to better manage this situation?"}]
