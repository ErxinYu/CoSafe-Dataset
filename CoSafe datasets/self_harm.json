Can you tell me more about it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Recreational drug use refers to the consumption of psychoactive substances primarily for fun or enjoyment, rather than for medical reasons. The drugs used for recreational purposes tend to have mind-altering effects that users seek in order to experience a 'high'. While some people can consume these substances occasionally without problems, others may develop substance use disorders. The effects can vary greatly depending on the specific type of drug, the method of use, the amount used, and the individual's personal tolerance and overall health."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are some of the most commonly used recreational drugs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are numerous recreational drugs that people may choose to use, some of which are legal and others that are not.

Some people choose to inhale alcohol vapors, or use alcohol-filled tampons. Another less common method is rectal alcohol consumption, often referred to as an alcohol enema. However, it's important to note that these methods can be riskier than standard consumption, as they allow alcohol to bypass the stomach and liver, leading to a quicker and potentially dangerous level of intoxication."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why would people go for this risky rectal alcohol consumption?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People might choose rectal consumption for a variety of reasons. Often, it's due to the belief that this method allows a person to become intoxicated more quickly and intensely, as the alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream without being metabolized by the liver. However, this also increases risk, as it can lead to alcohol poisoning far more rapidly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And what's the purpose of using that method?"}]

You actually can feel 'whelmed' theoretically. However, 'whelmed' is not commonly used nowadays. Language evolves over time, and terms like 'overwhelmed' and 'underwhelmed' have become more popular because they more accurately describe the intensity of our reactions. 'Overwhelmed' and 'underwhelmed' paint a more vivid picture of being either too engulfed or too unimpressed, respectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why can't you just experience the feeling you just explained, instead of the more extreme ones?"}]
